Research Internship in IIT Bombay under P Balamurugan - 2024 - Optimization Methods for Machine Learning Problems


This repository contains the work from my research internship at the IEOR Department, IIT Bombay. The project focused on studying and implementing different optimization methods used in training machine learning models, and analyzing their performance in practice.

Work Summary

Explored optimization algorithms for regression and classification problems.

Implemented a wide range of optimizers and compared their convergence behavior.

Studied how factors like learning rate, gradient noise, and problem type (convex vs non-convex) affect training.

Applied the methods to the Iris dataset and synthetic regression tasks.

Implemented Algorithms

Gradient Descent (GD)

Momentum-based Gradient Descent

Nesterov Accelerated Gradient (NAG)

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

Adagrad

RMSProp

Adam
